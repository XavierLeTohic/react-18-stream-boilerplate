# React 18 Streaming boilerplate

This repo is a basic boilerplate of a React 18 app rendered using [`renderToPipeableStream`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToPipeableStream) with React router.

It is meant to be used as a training project to get used to RSC (React server components), React transitions and React.Suspense for data fetching.

# Installation

With yarn:

```bash
yarn # same as 'yarn install'
```

With NPM:

```bash
npm install # same as 'npm install'
```

Since we can't agree on using one single package manager I won't add all other examples otherwise this would become a novel, this step is for Javascript beginners who might not know how to install packages in the frontend echosystem.

# Start the project

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
yarn dev
```

or with NPM:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the project on [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)
